# Audio Directory for LOCO Landing Page

This directory contains audio files for the LOCO single landing page.

## Required Files

- `loco-preview.mp3` - Audio snippet/preview of the LOCO single
  - Should be a short preview (30-60 seconds recommended)
  - Format: MP3
  - Quality: 128kbps or higher

## How to Add Your Audio

1. Export your audio snippet as MP3 format
2. Name it exactly `loco-preview.mp3`
3. Place it in this directory: `/public/audio/loco-preview.mp3`
4. The audio player on the landing page will automatically use this file

## Notes

- The audio player uses HTML5 `<audio>` element with custom styling
- Supports MP3 format (most compatible across browsers)
- File should be optimized for web (not too large for fast loading)
- Consider using a tool like Audacity or similar to create a clean preview snippet
