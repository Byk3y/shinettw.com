# The Magic Behind AUNTY MARY

When Spinall reached out about collaborating on a track, I knew it was going to be something special. The energy in the studio that day was electric - you could feel the creativity flowing through every beat.

## The Creative Process

Working with Spinall and Darkoo was an incredible experience. Each artist brought their unique style to the table:

- **Spinall**: His production skills are unmatched - the way he layers sounds creates this incredible depth
- **Darkoo**: Her vocals added this beautiful contrast that perfectly complemented the track
- **Me**: I brought the Afro Beats flavor that tied everything together

The track was recorded in Lagos, Nigeria, in Spinall's state-of-the-art studio. The energy of the city definitely influenced the final sound.

## The Recording Session

The recording process was intense but amazing. We spent three days perfecting every detail:

1. **Day 1**: Laying down the basic track structure
2. **Day 2**: Adding vocals and harmonies
3. **Day 3**: Final mixing and mastering
