# Encore Bi-Monthly Live Performance - What a Night! ðŸŽ¤

Last night's performance at Encore was absolutely incredible! The energy in the room was electric, and I'm still buzzing from the experience.

## The Venue

Encore has become one of my favorite venues in Lagos. The intimate setting creates this incredible connection between the artist and the audience. Every person in that room was part of the show.

## The Setlist

I performed a mix of my biggest hits and some new material:

1. **TIME** - The crowd went wild for this one!
2. **AUNTY MARY** - Everyone was singing along
3. **I Go** (Bob Sinclar collab) - The energy was insane
4. **New unreleased track** - First time performing this live

## The Audience

The audience was absolutely amazing! Their energy fueled every song, and I could feel their love and support throughout the entire performance. There's nothing quite like performing live music.
